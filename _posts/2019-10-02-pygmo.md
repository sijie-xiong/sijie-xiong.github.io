## The problematic way

According to the official [installation guide](https://esa.github.io/pagmo2/install.html#python) of PyGMO using Conda package manager, the summarized steps are:

### Step 1:  Check dependencies

- Mandatory
  - Python
  - The pagmo C++ library
  - The Boost.Python library
  - numpy
  - cloudpickle
- Optional
  - dill
  - matplotlib

Note that you can check if your system already has `boost` by typing in the command line `$ whereis boost`, if it prompts to `boost: $` then you're all set.

### Step 2:  Install PyGMO via conda

Add `conda-forge` to the channels, and then PyGMO can be installed through that channel.

```shell
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install pygmo
```

However, in step 2, adding (`--add`) the channel conda-forge puts it on top of the conda's default channel in the hierarchy.

```shell
$ conda config --add channels confa-forge
$ conda config --show channels
$ channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
```

This makes the `conda-forge` channel high in priority when relevant packages are searched/used/updated/..., and installing PyGMO with this hierarchy forces some of its dependent site packages that are present in the default channel to be downgraded. Even worse, unwanted removal of important packages can happen when performing `conda update` later on.

## The correct way

### Step 1:  Always start with a virtual environment!!!

It is always a good practice to create a virtual environment when working on some project which requires a new and complex module (e.g., optimization with PyGMO). No matter what goes wrong in that virtual environment, you can revert back by simply removing it, so there's no need to do the time-consuming reinstallation of anaconda.

```shell
$ conda create -n pygmo
$ conda activate pygmo
(pygmo) $ conda install dill
```

I'm using Python 3.7.3 and conda 4.7.12. The dependencies `numpy, cloudpickle, matplotlib` automatically come with the creation of pygmo environment. `dill` needs to be installed separately.

### Step 2:  Append conda-forge channel and install PyGMO

Instead of adding (`--add`) the channel conda-forge, we append (`--append`) it to the channels list so that the default one remains higher in priority.

```shell
$ conda config --append channels conda-forge
$ conda config --describe channel_priority
# # channel_priority (ChannelPriority)
# #   Accepts values of 'strict', 'flexible', and 'disabled'. The default
# #   value is 'flexible'. With strict channel priority, packages in lower
# #   priority channels are not considered if a package with the same name
# #   appears in a higher priority channel. With flexible channel priority,
# #   the solver may reach into lower priority channels to fulfill
# #   dependencies, rather than raising an unsatisfiable error. With channel
# #   priority disabled, package version takes precedence, and the
# #   configured priority of channels is used only to break ties. In
# #   previous versions of conda, this parameter was configured as either
# #   True or False. True is now an alias to 'flexible'.
# #
# channel_priority: strict
```

Make sure that the *channel_priority* is *flexible*, and then install PyGMO through the `conda-forge` channel.

```shell
$ conda config --set channel_priority flexible
$ conda install -c conda-forge pygmo
```
